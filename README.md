# Visual-AKDL-Editor
Editor that helps defining the syntax of a programing language you intend to create, in a tree (graph) representation.

Thanks to this editor, you donâ€™t need to have any knowledge on the notation used by AKDL (Another Keyword Definition Language).

After having defined your syntax, a structured (using custom packages) parsing and runtime code is generated.
